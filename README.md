# SendScriptWhatsApp

Code to send the entire Script of The Batman via WhatsApp.

## Usage

- Open [TheBatmanScript.js](https://github.com/andrelfmp3/SendTheBatmanScriptWhatsApp/blob/main/TheBatmanScript.js)

- Copy all the content (click on raw -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c).

- In WhatsApp Web, open the Browser console.

- Paste the code into the console and press Enter.

- Avoid leaving the chat until the process is complete.    

- Done.

### ⚠️ Important notice:

In some browsers, pasting scripts into the Console is blocked.

To work around this issue, the developer console expects to receive a text confirmation by typing in the console: "allow pasting", or similar

After this, pasting will be allowed and the script can be executed.
